TFS To GitLab Migration With Histories:
Step 1. First Install the Git TF latest version.
Step 2. Download the TFS source code from all repos and Branch using the following command to local drive and unzip folder.
		#git tfs clone <repo_path> <repository> <c:/temp>
Step 3. Create a one temporary repo and set/rest the remote.origin.url in git repo.
        #git remote set-url origin <repo-url>
Step 4. Upload all downloaded repoâ€™s to temporary repo. Check histories for confirmation.
        #git add *
        #git push origin master
Step 5. Clone temporary repos which contains all TFS repositories.
        #git clone <Temp_repo>
Step 6. Select one TFS repo and Create a repository with same name in Git then reset remote.origin.url
Step 7. Remove all repository/folders/branch which are not part of repository then upload to GitLab repo.
        #git rm -r <repo_name>
        #git add .
		#git commit -m <Comment>
        #git push origin master

NOTE: If you want the same branching structure in GitLab as well, then create all branches and perform the step 7.
