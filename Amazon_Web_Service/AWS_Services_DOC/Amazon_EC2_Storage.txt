###---Amazon Storage---###
-> Amazon EC2 provides you with flexible, cost effective, and easy-to-use data storage options for your instances.
-> Types of storage option for EC2:
	(1) Amazon Elastic Block Storage(EBS)
	(2) Amazon Elastic File system(EFS)
	(3) Amazon Simple Storage Service(S3) 
	(4) Amazon EC2 Instance Storage.
	
Amazon EBS:
	-> Amazon EBS provides durable, block-level storage volumes that you can attach to a running instance. 
	-> After an EBS volume is attached to an instance, you can use it like any other physical hard drive. 
	-> You can use Amazon EBS as a primary storage device for data that requires frequent and granular updates.
	-> You can also detach an EBS volume from one instance and attach it to another instance.
	-> EBS volumes can also be created as encrypted volumes using the Amazon EBS encryption feature.
	-> To keep a backup copy of your data, you can create a snapshot of an EBS volume, which is stored in Amazon S3. 
	-> You can create an EBS volume from a snapshot, and attach it to another instance. 
	
Amazon EFS:
	-> Amazon EFS provides scalable file storage for use with Amazon EC2. 
	-> You can create an EFS file system and configure your instances to mount the file system. 
	-> You can use an EFS file system as a common data source for workloads and applications running on multiple instances.
	-> Amazon EFS is not supported on Windows instances.
	
Amazon S3:
	-> Amazon S3 has a simple web services interface that you can use to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web.
	-> you can use Amazon S3 to store backup copies of your data and applications. 
	-> Amazon EC2 uses Amazon S3 to store EBS snapshots and instance store-backed AMIs.
	-> you can copy a file to or from Amazon S3 and your instance using method.
		[ec2-user ~]$ wget https://my_bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/path-to-file
	-> To copy an object from Amazon S3 to your instance.
		[ec2-user ~]$ aws s3 cp my_copied_file.ext s3://my_bucket/my_folder/my_file.ext
	-> To download an entire Amazon S3 bucket to a local directory on your instance.
		[ec2-user ~]$ aws s3 sync s3://remote_S3_bucket local_directory
		
Amazon EC2 Instance Store:
	-> Many instances can access storage from disks that are physically attached to the host computer. This disk storage is referred to as instance store. Instance store provides temporary block-level storage for instances. 
	-> The data on an instance store volume persists only during the life of the associated instance; if you stop or terminate an instance, any data on instance store volumes is lost.
